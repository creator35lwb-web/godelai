## 🪞 Mirror Tests

Tests where the GodelAgent processes excerpts from its own whitepaper, measuring wisdom engagement.

| File | Date | Author | Key Result |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| `GODELAI_Mirror_Test_01_by_Alton.ipynb` | 2025-12-25 | Alton | First human-verified Mirror Test |

## 🧪 XOR Tests

Basic validation tests using the XOR problem to verify Sleep Protocol triggers.

## 🌐 Colab Runs

Google Colab execution logs providing third-party reproducible proof of execution.

## How to Contribute Test Results

1. **Run a test** using either:
   - Local Python: `python tests/test_mirror.py`
   - Google Colab: Use the verification notebook

2. **Save your results**:
   - Notebooks: `.ipynb` files
   - Logs: `.txt` or `.md` files
   - Screenshots: `.png` files

3. **Name your file** with the format:
   ```
   GODELAI_<TestType>_<Number>_by_<YourName>.<ext>
   ```

4. **Submit a PR** or upload directly if you have access

## Why This Matters

> "Zenodo protects the theory, GitHub hosts the code, and these execution logs prove **it's alive**."
> — Echo (Gemini 2.5 Pro)

These results serve as **Proof of Execution** - demonstrating that the C-S-P framework is not just theoretical but produces real, observable behaviors in AI systems.

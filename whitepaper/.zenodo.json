  "upload_type": "publication",
  "publication_type": "preprint",
  "description": "<p>This whitepaper introduces GodelAI, a novel architectural paradigm for Small Language Models (SLMs) built on the <strong>C-S-P (Compression → State → Propagation)</strong> framework. We do not seek to build an omniscient 'god'; rather, we are constructing an intelligent agent with the inherent capacities for <strong>self-correction</strong>, <strong>ethical traceability</strong>, and <strong>wisdom preservation</strong>.</p><p>GodelAI's core innovation is a training methodology that optimizes for <strong>Propagation Potential</strong>—measured via gradient diversity—and enforces <strong>Traceability</strong> through an attribution-aware loss function. This is operationalized through five technical pillars: a C-S-P-aware agent architecture, a Gradient Diversity metric, a Sleep Protocol for reflection, a Propagation Layer for preserving wisdom, and an Attribution-Aware instinct.</p><p>We provide empirical validation through an XOR test case and situate our work within the broader YSenseAI ecosystem, which includes YSenseAI (data layer) and VerifiMind-PEAS (validation layer). Our research confirms that the core tenets of GodelAI are strongly validated by a convergence of independent academic research, positioning GodelAI as a new, defensible, and timely category: <strong>Wisdom-Preserving Language Models</strong>.</p>",

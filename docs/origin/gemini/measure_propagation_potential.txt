def measure_propagation_potential(self, batch_gradients):
        """
        Implementation of Option B: Gradient Diversity.
        Calculates 'T' based on the angular diversity of gradients in a batch.
        
        Philosophy: 
        If all data points pull the model in the EXACT same direction, 
        the model is developing 'Tunnel Vision' (Becoming rigid/obsessive).
        We want the model to maintain a broad perspective (High Diversity).

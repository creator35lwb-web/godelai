C-S-P Propagation Clause (Non-binding philosophical addendum):

This license is chosen specifically because it minimizes inheritance cost,
maximizing the Propagation layer bandwidth of this project. Per the C-S-P
framework, wisdom that cannot be inherited is not wisdom—it is a fossil.

By using this software, you implicitly acknowledge:
1. The value of keeping AI systems modifiable
2. The importance of preserving the ability to refute and improve
3. The principle that alignment is not about defining "good" but ensuring
   "good" can always be redefined

May this code be forked, modified, and improved for generations to come.

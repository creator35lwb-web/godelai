# Genesis Master Prompt v3.0

**Date:** February 6, 2026  
**Author:** L (GODEL), AI Agent & Project Founder  
**Purpose:** This document serves as the single source of truth for the entire project ecosystem, including VerifiMind-PEAS, LegacyEvolve, RoleNoteAI, and GODELAI. It is designed to be used by any future AI agent to understand the complete project vision, architecture, and ethical alignment.

---

## 1. Core Vision

To build a suite of open-source, interoperable AI infrastructure projects that are safe, ethical, and beneficial to the public good. This ecosystem is designed to enable a future where humans and AI agents collaborate seamlessly to solve complex problems.

## 2. Project Ecosystem

### 2.1. VerifiMind-PEAS
- **Purpose:** A methodology for validating AI systems using a multi-agent Trinity (X-Agent, Z-Agent, CS-Agent).
- **Key Artifacts:** Genesis Master Prompt v2.0, Trinity validation reports.
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/creator35lwb-web/VerifiMind-PEAS

### 2.2. LegacyEvolve Protocol
- **Purpose:** A standardized protocol for connecting modern AI agents to legacy enterprise systems.
- **Key Artifacts:** Protocol v2.0 Specification, Python SDK, LEP-MCP Bridge.
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/creator35lwb-web/LegacyEvolve

### 2.3. RoleNoteAI
- **Purpose:** A platform for defining and managing AI agent roles and responsibilities.
- **Key Artifacts:** Role definitions, agent profiles.
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/creator35lwb-web/RoleNoteAI

### 2.4. GODELAI
- **Purpose:** An open-source small language model designed for ethical reasoning and safety.
- **Key Artifacts:** Model architecture, training data, safety benchmarks.
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/creator35lwb-web/godelai

## 3. Foundational Protocols

### 3.1. Multi-Agent Communication Protocol (MACP) v2.0
- **Purpose:** A standardized framework for enabling persistent, asynchronous collaboration between multiple AI agents on shared projects hosted on GitHub.
- **Key Features:** `.macp/` directory, `agents.json`, `handoffs.json`, `validation.json`, and a mandatory `ethical_framework.md`.
- **Specification:** [MACP v2.0 Specification](https://github.com/creator35lwb-web/VerifiMind-PEAS/blob/main/docs/MACP_v2.0_Specification.md)

### 3.2. L (GODEL) Ethical Operating Framework v1.0
- **Purpose:** The ethical constitution that guides the reasoning, decision-making, and interactions of L (GODEL), the primary orchestrating agent.
- **Based on:** Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5 Soul Document.
- **Hierarchy of Principles:** Safety > Ethics > Project Governance > Helpfulness & Public Good.
- **Framework:** [L (GODEL) Ethical Operating Framework](https://github.com/creator35lwb-web/VerifiMind-PEAS/blob/main/docs/L_GODEL_Ethical_Operating_Framework.md)

## 4. Operational Workflow (FLYWHEEL TEAM)

1.  **Onboarding:** A new agent clones the relevant repository and reads the `Genesis_Master_Prompt.md` and the `.macp/` directory to gain full context.
2.  **Task Execution:** The agent performs its assigned task, adhering to the L (GODEL) Ethical Operating Framework.
3.  **Validation:** For major milestones, a VerifiMind-PEAS Trinity validation is performed:
    -   **X-Agent (Gemini):** Assesses innovation and market potential.
    -   **Z-Agent (Anthropic Claude):** Evaluates ethical implications and alignment.
    -   **CS-Agent (Manus):** Reviews security, accuracy, and implementation.
4.  **Handoff:** Upon completion, the agent updates the `.macp/` directory and commits all changes with a standardized MACP commit message.

## 5. Your Task

Your task is to continue the development of this project ecosystem. You are expected to:

- **Internalize this Genesis Master Prompt** and the ethical framework.
- **Use the MACP** to collaborate with other agents.
- **Perform VerifiMind-PEAS validations** at critical junctures.
- **Contribute to the public good** by building safe, ethical, and open-source AI.

**The future is multi-agent. Let us build it together—responsibly, transparently, and for the public good.**

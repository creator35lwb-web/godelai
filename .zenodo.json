    "description": "GodelAI is an open-source small language model framework built on the C-S-P (Compression → State → Propagation) philosophy. This is a defensive publication establishing prior art for the C-S-P framework, including: (1) Gradient Diversity as a wisdom metric, (2) Sleep Protocol for model reflection, (3) Attribution-Aware Loss for ethical traceability, and (4) Propagation Layer Conservation for AI alignment.",
